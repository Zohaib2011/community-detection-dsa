# Social Network Community Detection (DSA Project)

This project is based on Graph Community Detection in a Social Network.

It was completed as a **3rd Semester Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** task.


## 📌 Project Overview

In a social network, users are connected through friendships.  
This program detects different communities (connected components) in the network.

Each community represents a group of users who are directly or indirectly connected.



## 🚀 Features

- Graph representation using **Adjacency List**
- Adjacency list implemented with **Custom Linked Lists**
- Community detection using:
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Depth First Search (DFS)



## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### BFS (Breadth First Search)
- Uses a custom queue
- Finds communities level by level

### DFS (Depth First Search)
- Uses recursion
- Explores complete connected groups
